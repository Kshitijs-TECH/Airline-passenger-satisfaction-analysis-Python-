# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis & Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes airline passenger data to understand the factors influencing customer satisfaction. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques are applied to extract insights and build a classification model to predict passenger satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
Airlines need to improve customer experience by identifying key service and travel factors that affect passenger satisfaction.  
This project aims to analyze passenger data and build a predictive model to classify satisfaction levels.

---

## Dataset
- Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dataset  
- Contains passenger demographics, travel details, service ratings, and satisfaction status  
- Target Variable: Passenger Satisfaction  

---

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize patterns and distributions in passenger data
- Identify key factors affecting satisfaction
- Build and evaluate a classification model

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses were performed:
- Gender and travel type distribution
- Flight distance analysis using violin plots
- Correlation heatmap for numerical features
- Identification of important relationships between variables

---

## Machine Learning Workflow
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Train–test split to evaluate generalization performance
- Classification model implementation using Scikit-learn

---

## Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using standard classification metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision

This ensures reliable performance on unseen data.
